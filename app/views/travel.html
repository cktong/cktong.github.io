	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>I love to travel. Right is a diagram of the places that I have visited and would like to go to. The D3 diagram was inspired by <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4973620">@dwtkns</a>.</p>
	<p>I document the trips through photography. None of the photographs have been altered in any way. </p>
