	<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p> I am a recent graduate of UC Berkeley working in the intersection between numbers and aesthetics. I enjoy telling stories with data and aspire to build products that utilize technology to unobtrusively solve issues in the built and natural environment. I like cities. I am based in San Francisco, California and currently work in South Korea.</p>
