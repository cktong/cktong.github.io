I majored in Operation Research but design is how I keep sane! This website as a repository for my thoughts and interests.</p><p>I tell stories with data. The web is my medium and coding is the means to that end. This site is made with HTML, Javascript and no small dosage of Google and Stack Overflow. Hosted by Heroku.</p><p>I lived in San Francisco for most of my life but currently work in South Korea. See my projects, read my resume and feel free to reach out!</p></div>
