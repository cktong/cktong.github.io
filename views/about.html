I enjoy telling stories with data and aspire to build products that utilize technology to unobtrusively solve issues in the built and natural environment. I like cities. I am based in San Francisco, California and currently work in South Korea.</p><h3>About this Site</h3><p>This site was designed as a repository for my thoughts and interests.
